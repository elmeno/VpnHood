How a user knows that he has been disconnected by another session?

* Server keeps sessions alive for SessionTimeout
* Any other session with same clientId will be closed on new session creation; the dead session will be alive till SessionTimeout but market as closed
* Any connections to closed session will be replied by error message that indicates he was disconnected by another session
* No error message if sessionId is not detected! no fingerprint to prevent server query
